ICICI Insurance Claims Processing and Analytics Pipeline
Problem Statement
ICICI Insurance receives insurance claim events in JSON format from multiple digital channels such as mobile apps, partner hospitals, and agent portals.
The raw claim data needs to be processed in Databricks, orchestrated using Azure Data Factory, and stored in Snowflake for analytics.
The claims data contains nested and semi-structured information including policy details, claimant information, treatment details, and payment status.
Business teams require structured and queryable data in Snowflake to analyze approved claim amounts by insurance type and region.
